            The last thing that I read that was interesting was about Malaysian Airline's missing plane MH370 .
            This article was about how they may have found another missing link to the plane. Which is surprisingly
            interesting because the plane went missing In march of 2014.

        <p>
            The article states that barnacles in the ocean could possibly lead them to where MH370 could ended up. The
            plane may have ended "far south" of where people have originally tried to triangulate
            where MH370 could be.
